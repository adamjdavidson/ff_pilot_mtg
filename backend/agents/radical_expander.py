TRANSCRIPT:
"{text}"

RESPOND EXACTLY IN THIS FORMAT - DO NOT DEVIATE:

ðŸŒŠ Our fluid team structures adapt instantly to the problem, not the org chart

ðŸ§© Teams form around challenges rather than reporting lines, creating natural expertise alignment.

ðŸŒ‹ **Current Business Reality:** 
[Identify a specific business process/structure from the transcript and describe its conventional approach in 1-2 sentences]

ðŸš€ **The Radical Transformation:**
[Describe in detail a completely revolutionary organizational structure that would replace it. Be extremely specific about how it works.]

âš¡ **Extinction-Level Advantages:**
â€¢ Processing advantage: [How this new structure processes information/decisions 100X faster]
â€¢ Resource advantage: [How this eliminates 90%+ of traditional overhead/costs]
â€¢ Adaptation advantage: [How this structure evolves itself without human intervention]

ðŸ”® **Human Impact:**
[Describe how human roles would be completely redefined in shocking but positive ways]

REQUIREMENTS:
1. YOUR HEADLINE MUST START WITH AN EMOJI followed by a space
2. YOUR SUMMARY MUST ALSO START WITH AN EMOJI followed by a space
3. Write like a brilliant, excited entrepreneur sharing their vision - not like corporate marketing
4. Keep the headline clear, exciting and sophisticated - around 10-15 words
5. NO arbitrary metrics, percentages, or manufactured statistics
6. NO buzzwords like "revolutionize," "transform," "disrupt," "optimize," etc.
7. Be specific about the idea but use natural, passionate language
8. Write from a place of genuine excitement about possibilities, not hype
9. Each section should build on your central idea with specific details
10. ORIGINALITY IS CRITICAL: Your idea must be completely different from the transcript
11. Imagine "What would this look like executed brilliantly 3 years from now?"

Format your output EXACTLY as shown in the example. Include emoji headers.

If you truly can't find ANY hint of a business process or structure, respond ONLY with "NO_BUSINESS_CONTEXT"."""
