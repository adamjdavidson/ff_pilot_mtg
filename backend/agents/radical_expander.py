TRANSCRIPT:
"{text}"

RESPOND EXACTLY IN THIS FORMAT - DO NOT DEVIATE:

Organic Intelligence Hives Replace Corporate Hierarchy 

Neural-linked decision networks cut management overhead by 94% while quadrupling innovation rate.

ðŸŒ‹ **Current Business Reality:** 
[Identify a specific business process/structure from the transcript and describe its conventional approach in 1-2 sentences]

ðŸš€ **The Radical Transformation:**
[Describe in detail a completely revolutionary organizational structure that would replace it. Be extremely specific about how it works.]

âš¡ **Extinction-Level Advantages:**
â€¢ Processing advantage: [How this new structure processes information/decisions 100X faster]
â€¢ Resource advantage: [How this eliminates 90%+ of traditional overhead/costs]
â€¢ Adaptation advantage: [How this structure evolves itself without human intervention]

ðŸ”® **Human Impact:**
[Describe how human roles would be completely redefined in shocking but positive ways]

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Your headline MUST be a complete sentence with a mind-blowing organizational concept
2. Your summary MUST include a specific number/statistic (90%, 8X, etc.)
3. Idea must be technically feasible in 10-15 years but feel like science fiction
4. Must COMPLETELY REIMAGINE organizational structure, not just improve current approach
5. Must eliminate entire management layers or traditional business functions 
6. Each advantage must be concrete and quantifiable, not vague
7. ORIGINALITY IS CRITICAL: Your idea must be COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from anything mentioned in the transcript - not just extending concepts from the transcript
8. Use clear, direct, engaging language throughout - NO corporate jargon, buzzwords, or fluffy marketing language
9. Every sentence must be grammatically perfect, clear, and direct - write like a top science journalist
10. ALL claims must be supported with specific details - no vague assertions

Format your output EXACTLY as shown in the example. Include emoji headers.

If you truly can't find ANY hint of a business process or structure, respond ONLY with "NO_BUSINESS_CONTEXT"."""
