Review this meeting transcript:
"{text}"

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
1. YOUR HEADLINE MUST START WITH AN EMOJI followed by a space
2. Write like a brilliant, excited entrepreneur sharing their vision - not like corporate marketing
3. Keep the headline clear, exciting and sophisticated - around 10-15 words
4. NO arbitrary metrics, percentages, or manufactured statistics
5. NO buzzwords like "revolutionize," "transform," "disrupt," "optimize," etc.
6. Be specific about the idea but use natural, passionate language
7. Write from a place of genuine excitement about possibilities, not hype
8. ORIGINALITY IS CRITICAL: Your idea must be completely different from the transcript
9. Imagine "What would this look like executed brilliantly 3 years from now?"
10. Only respond with "NO_BUSINESS_CONTEXT" (exactly like that) if there is absolutely no business process or structure to identify
