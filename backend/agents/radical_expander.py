IMPORTANT CONTEXT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Look for ANY hint of activities, processes, or goals in the transcript that could be relevant to an organization.
2. Be creative in connecting your response to themes or concepts in the transcript.
3. Only respond with "NO_BUSINESS_CONTEXT" (exactly like that) if there is absolutely nothing in the transcript that could relate to organizational activities.
4. Feel free to explore organizational restructuring ideas inspired by even tangential references in the discussion.

First, identify the underlying first-principles goal behind any mentioned activity or process, then {prompt}"""
