## Key Themes

In this article, Ethan Mollick argues that companies are mistakenly approaching AI as a cost-cutting tool, similar to how they might have viewed the steam engine during the Industrial Revolution. Instead, he suggests that the real value of AI will come from employees discovering and unlocking its "latent expertise" through experimentation and domain-specific knowledge.

AI adoption has two waves:
- Individual use (already successful)
- Organizational integration (currently in progress)

Most companies are making a mistake by:
- Viewing AI primarily as a way to reduce costs
- Implementing centralized IT solutions
- Not allowing employees to explore AI's potential

Unlocking AI's potential requires:
- Experts who can judge AI's output in their specific domain
- Trial and error approaches
- Understanding that AI works more like a person than traditional software

## Examples of Latent Expertise

The article provides several examples where domain experts have unlocked valuable AI applications:
- AI outperforming doctors in disease diagnosis
- Creating more engaging job descriptions
- Potential for reading analog gauges in manufacturing

## Recommendation

Mollick recommends encouraging employees to experiment with AI, share their findings, and gradually build organizational understanding of AI's capabilities. The true breakthrough will come from workers discovering unique AI applications within their specific work contexts.

Companies should view everyone as being in R&D when it comes to AI, with ideas coming "from the edges, not the center."
