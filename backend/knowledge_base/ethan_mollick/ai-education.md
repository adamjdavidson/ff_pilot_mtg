Our educational system is one of the biggest knowledge industries in the world — and the research on how people learn is constantly evolving. How will AI change our approach to teaching and learning?

Artificial intelligence (AI) has reignited a range of debates about the future of technology. One of the largest of these is how learning and education should change as AI becomes a bigger part of our daily lives. Will AI reduce the human element in education, eliminating mentorship and inspiration? Will it simply speed up and personalize feedback, without changing the overall approach? To me, both of these approaches seem too narrow. Rather than focusing on AI for rote tasks or supplementary support, we should be thinking about how AI can transform learning more fundamentally — and more positively.

To do so effectively, we need to do a few things. We need to be clear-eyed about how we learn today, and how learning differs for experts, students, and those engaged in professional growth. We need AI systems that are tailored to these distinct learning needs, not just general-purpose tools. And we need to empower educators to use these tools to reimagine their teaching.

## Blending Human and AI Models

Most instruction today happens via what's called "explicit teaching," where students are directly taught concepts (like photosynthesis, linear regression, or the causes of World War I) through lessons, lectures, and textbooks. Humans are well-suited for explicit teaching because we can break down complex topics and explain them in ways that learners can understand. But we're limited in how much personalization we can offer, especially at scale.

A complementary approach is "implicit teaching," or learning by observation. This involves watching someone else perform a task, like debugging code, designing an experiment, or critiquing a novel. These activities are traditionally harder to teach explicitly — you need to learn by doing and getting feedback from experts. It's the sort of learning that takes place during a PhD program or while working under a skilled mentor.

AI has the potential to expand both approaches. For explicit teaching, AI can provide on-demand, personalized feedback tailored to each student's needs — something researchers have long known improves outcomes. It can interact in a conversational way, adapting to questions and providing explanations where a student is struggling, even sharing alternative approaches if certain explanations aren't clicking.

For implicit teaching, the potential of AI is even more transformative. By discussing, reasoning through, and demonstrating approaches to complex problems, AI can make expert processes more transparent. Rather than just the final answer, AI can show the steps and reasoning that would otherwise remain hidden in an expert's head.

## Learning about Learning

I believe that this intersection of human-like interaction, personalization, and transparency offers us a window into a future where AI can transform our approaches to learning, not merely accelerate them. For instance, I (along with researcher Lilach Mollick) am part of a team creating a custom AI system, Delphi, for one of my classes at Wharton. Delphi can not only answer specific questions, but it also knows the entire course content (including case studies, videos, and articles), which allows it to provide assistance in a variety of ways. Students can get clarification on concepts, ask for help on assignments, or discuss case studies in depth. Delphi combines both explicit teaching (explaining concepts) and implicit teaching (demonstrating analysis).

Though we're only just beginning to explore the potential of Delphi, early research suggests that AI systems can help students learn by providing feedback via targeted questions, asking them to explain their thought process, and encouraging reflection. In other contexts, AI has improved engagement and learning outcomes by creating a non-judgmental environment where students feel comfortable making mistakes. Education needs both the human element — mentorship, inspiration, and motivation — and effective tools to help students better engage with the material.

## Different Learners, Different Needs

To do this well, we need to acknowledge how learning varies across different contexts. In education, researchers distinguish between novice learners (early in their educational journey), adaptive experts (who can apply knowledge flexibly), and transformative experts (who can create new knowledge in their field).

The way we use AI in education should be tailored to each of these different learning stages. For novice learners, AI can provide the right level of support at the right time: answering questions, offering explanations, and giving feedback that helps build fundamental knowledge and confidence.

For adaptive experts — professionals adding skills or adapting to new fields — AI can serve as a thinking partner, helping them connect new information to existing knowledge. Since these learners already have domain expertise, AI can provide targeted guidance while highlighting connections they might miss. Here, the goal is to help them transfer knowledge from one domain to another and develop the ability to apply their expertise flexibly in new contexts.

For transformative experts pushing the boundaries of their fields, AI becomes a tool for boundary exploration — running simulations, testing hypotheses, generating new ideas, and automating repetitive tasks. These experts need AI that helps them efficiently expand knowledge frontiers rather than revisit basics. The emphasis is on using AI to amplify human creativity and extend intellectual reach, not to replace the fundamentally human process of innovation.

Education sits at the intersection of the largest knowledge systems in the world, and AI is transforming how we interact with knowledge. But we've also seen this kind of educational transformation before. When calculators became widespread in schools, we didn't stop teaching math — we changed how we taught it. Similarly, with AI, we need to reorient what we teach and how we teach it. This means focusing more on how to solve problems, how to verify information, and how to think critically, rather than having students memorize information that can now be more easily accessed through AI.

Rather than assuming that AI should take over tasks like grading and assessment, or else be banned outright, I believe we should focus on developing AI tools that align with proven educational principles. The key challenge is to design AI that complements and enhances human teaching, not replacing it but extending the unique role that educators play in motivating, mentoring, and inspiring students.

This means giving educators — not just AI specialists or technologists — a voice in how these systems develop. It means training them to use AI effectively in their teaching. And it means building AI teaching tools that make their expertise a key input to the system, enabling them to create experiences that reflect their educational philosophy and approach.
