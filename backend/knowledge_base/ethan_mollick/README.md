# Ethan Mollick Knowledge Base

This directory contains articles, blog posts, and excerpts from Ethan Mollick's writings to provide the Ethan Mollick agent with relevant knowledge and context.

## Source Format

Each file should be a markdown (.md) document with the following structure:

```markdown
# Title of the Article/Post

Source: [URL or book reference]
Date: [Publication date]
Tags: [comma-separated tags]

[Full text content]
```

## Adding New Content

To add new content to the knowledge base:
1. Create a new markdown file with a descriptive name (e.g., `ai-transforming-work-2023.md`)
2. Follow the format above
3. Place the file in this directory

The agent will automatically process these files when responding to queries.
